## 📓 Guidelines

### Git Branch Strategy

### 📌 Naming Conventions

| Prefix | Usage |
| :-------: | :------:|
| **feat/** | New feature development |
| **fix/** | Bug fixes |
| **hotfix/** | Critical productions fixes |
| **docs/** | Documentation updates |
| **test/** | Testing-relating work |
| **refactor/** | Code refactoring |
| **chore/** | Maintenance and tooling |
| **poc/** | Proof of concept for feasibility testing |

#### 🔷 Examples

```git
feat/user-authentication
fix/navbar-alignment
docs/project-guidelines
chore/update-dependencies
```

#### 🔄 Workflow

##### 1. Main Branch

- `main: Production-ready code`
- `dev: Integration branch for new features`

##### 2. Feature workflow

- Create a branch : `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
- Push and open a pull request to dev
- Merge or only after 2 approval review

##### 3. Proof of Concept (PoC) workflow

- Create a PoC branch : `git checkout -b poc/your-concept`
- Test feasibility before integrating into `feature/` branches
- if validated, merge into a feature branch or discard

### Commit Messages Conventions

#### Why use a structured commit format ?

A clear and consistent commit message format improves readability, history tracking and automation (e.g., changelogs, release notes, etc)

#### Conventionnal commit format

`<type>(<scope>): <message>`

##### 🔷 Types of commits

| Type | Usages |
| :------: | :-----:|
| **feat** | A new feature. Correlates with MINOR in SemVer |
| **fix** | A bug fix. Correlates with PATCH in SemVer |
| **docs** | Documentation only changes |
| **test** | Adding missing or correcting existing tests |
| **build** | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scope: pip, docker, npm)
| **refactor** | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| **style** | Changes that do not affect the meaning of th code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons etc.) |
| **perf** | A code change that improves performance |
| **ci** | CI/CD related updates |

#### 📌 Examples

```git
feat(auth): add JWT authentication middlewares
fix(ui): resolve navbar rendering issue
chore(git): add logs to .gitgnore
docs(readme): update installation guide
```
